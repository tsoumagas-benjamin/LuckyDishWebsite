# Lucky Dish Website üçΩÔ∏è

## Overview
Lucky Dish provides customers a seamless and visually pleasing experience in viewing the menu and information about the restaurant. Users should be able to search the menu items, filter by category (breakfast/lunch/dinner/dessert/etc.) and view menu item costs and nutritional value at a glance. As a health conscious restaurant, dishes should be labeled for common dietary restrictions such as vegan/vegetarian/nut-free. As well the website should facilitate easy ordering and ways to see the total at a glance.

## Features
- Search & Filter Menu Items  
- View Nutritional Information  
- Place an Order and See Total Cost  
- Dietary Labels for Vegan, Vegetarian, and Nut-Free Dishes
